The Office for Scholarly Communication spearheads campus-wide initiatives to open, share, and preserve scholarship. With support from OSC, all Harvard schools have now adopted [open-access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/) for new scholarly articles by faculty. Harvard research centers have also begun to adopt open-access policies, including the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, and the Harvard University Center for the Environment.

The OSC also runs supporting programs such as:

- [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository;
- [HOPE]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/), a fund to reimburse processing fees for articles published in fee-based open-access journals;
- [COPE](http://www.oacompact.org/), a multi-university compact to underwrite publication charges for fee-based open-access journals;
- Harvard's [Copyright Advisory Program](http://copyright.lib.harvard.edu/), including the [Copyright First Responders]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders/).

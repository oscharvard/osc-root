<p>The HOPE Fund has reached its annual budgetary limit and is not accepting new applications for the remainder of the year. We thank all of our funded authors for allowing HOPE to support their open-access publications.
Harvard affiliates, please contact the Office for Scholarly Communication if you would like information about no-fee open-access journals or instructions for depositing accepted author manuscripts in DASH.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make your work open access, and we are always here to help. Thank you!</p></aside>

The Harvard Open-Access Publishing Equity (HOPE) fund provides funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees for articles authored or co-authored by Harvard researchers published in [eligible open-access journals]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/faq/#eligible-venues) for which no alternative funding is available.

The HOPE fund is Harvard's implementation of the [Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity](http://www.oacompact.org/).

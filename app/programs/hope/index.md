[Apply](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/hope/) for HOPE funds.

The Harvard Open-Access Publishing Equity (HOPE) fund provides funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees for articles authored or co-authored by Harvard researchers published in [eligible open-access journals]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/faq/#eligible-venues) for which no alternative funding is available.

The HOPE fund is Harvard's implementation of the [Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity](http://www.oacompact.org/).

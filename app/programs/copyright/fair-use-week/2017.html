<p><strong>February 20-24</strong></p>

<p>Harvard is delighted to be celebrating the fourth annual <a href="http://www.fairuseweek.org/">Fair Use Week</a> this year, an opportunity to bring attention to the “essential limitations and exceptions to copyright” and “balance in copyright law, promoting further progress and accommodating freedom of speech and expression” that fair use (and fair dealing) represent.</p>

<p>Hatched in 2014 at Harvard by Copyright Advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKCourtney">Kyle K. Courtney</a> as campus-only pilot, Fair Use Week has since become an internationally celebrated event thanks to the generous support from and promotion by the <a href="http://www.arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/">Office for Scholarly Communication</a> invites you to participate in this year’s <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/programs/copyright/fair-use-week/2017/">Fair Use Week</a> by following the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/">posts on our blog</a> from national and international fair use guest experts, <a href="http://fairuseweek.tumblr.com">exploring fair use success stories</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fairuseweek">participating in fair use conversations</a>.</p>

<p>We are also delighted to host a screening and panel discussion of <a href="http://www.otherpeoplesfootage.com/">Other People’s Footage</a>, deliver a new fair use comic, and co-host a “Fan Fiction &amp; Fair Use” panel with MIT. </p>

<p>As always, our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders">Copyright First Responders</a> will act as official ambassadors of Fair Use Week, donning t-shirts and starting conversations around campus and online. If you have fair use questions, please acquaint yourself with your local CFR. They are always on hand to help you work through fair use analyses (and any other copyright question you may have).</p>

<p>We hope you will join in the upcoming Harvard-based Fair Use Week festivities and read a roundup of the events after the fact. You may also find information on other local and national events listed on the <a href="http://fairuseweek.org/">ARL's Fair Use Week website</a>.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/FairUseWeek">@FairUseWeek</a> for a chance to win a warm and snazzy Fair Use Week beanie. And thank you for joining us in celebrating the power of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">the four factors</a> to transform teaching, learning, and&nbsp;scholarship.</p>

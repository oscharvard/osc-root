<p><strong>February 22-26</strong></p>

<p>Harvard is delighted to be participating in the third annual <a href="http://www.fairuseweek.org/">Fair Use Week</a>. This is an opportunity for the University community to celebrate the fair use doctrine, which "facilitate[s] balance in copyright law, promoting further progress and accommodating freedom of speech and expression." The fair use of images, text, and more in scholarly work and beyond is essential, from student dissertations to faculty scholarship, MOOCs, and more.</p>

<p>Fair Use Week launched in 2014 when Kyle K. Courtney, the Office for Scholarly Communication's (OSC's) Program Manager and Copyright Advisor, turned the idea that was tossed out as a lark at a conference into a noteworthy event. It now enjoys the sponsorship of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and is being celebrated internationally.</p>

<p>We invite you to explore the upcoming Harvard-based Fair Use Week festivities and read a roundup of the events after the fact. You may also find other local and national events, which will be listed on the <a href="http://www.fairuseweek.org/">ARL's Fair Use Week website</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to attending the events listed below, you may celebrate Fair Use Week by following the activity on the OSC's <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/">copyright blog</a>, which will feature guest posts from fair use experts; <a href="http://fairuseweek.tumblr.com/">Fair Use Week Tumblr</a>, which will feature fair use stories; and <a href="https://twitter.com/FairUseWeek">Fair Use Week Twitter feed</a>, which will keep you up to date on Fair Use Week conversations.</p>

<p>Do you have fair use questions? If so, acquaint yourself with your local <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders">Copyright First Responder</a>. They are always on hand to help you work through your fair use analysis.</p>

    <p>The third-annual Fair Use Week at Harvard kicked off with an RTL Shares&ndash;sponsored event aimed at empowering front-line library staff to address basic fair use questions. Kyle Courtney and Emily Bell framed their discussion of the fair use doctrine and its application over time with examples from Emily's experience on the reference desk. Following their review of the four factors, Kyle and Emily fielded a lively question and answer session from the standing-room-only audience that covered ground from the fair use of an international work to the difference between a transformative use of a work and a derivative work.</p>

<p><strong>February 26-March 2</strong></p>

<p>It is with great delight that Harvard will be celebrating the sixth anniversary <a href="http://www.fairuseweek.org/">Fair Use Week</a> this year, which represents another opportunity to showcase the "balance in copyright law, promoting further progress and accommodating freedom of speech and expression" that fair use (and fair dealing) represent.</p>

<p>Launched in 2014 at Harvard by Copyright Advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKCourtney">Kyle K. Courtney</a> as a campus-only pilot, Fair Use Week has since become an internationally celebrated event thanks to the generous support from and promotion by the <a href="http://www.arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/">Office for Scholarly Communication</a> invites you to participate in this year’s <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/programs/copyright/fair-use-week/2019/">Fair Use Week</a> by following the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/">posts on our blog</a> from national and international fair use guest experts, <a href="http://fairuseweek.tumblr.com">exploring fair use success stories</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fairuseweek">participating in fair use conversations</a>.</p>

<p>We will also have a Copyright Expert Question &amp; Answer Booth in Widener Library run by our <a href="https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/copyright-first-responders">Copyright First Responders</a> – the official ambassadors of Fair Use Week at Harvard Library. The CFR’s will be donning Fair Use Week t-shirts and starting conversations around campus and online. If you have fair use questions, please acquaint yourself with your local CFR. They are always on hand to help you work through fair use analyses (and any other copyright question you may have).</p>

<p>We hope you will join in the upcoming Harvard-based Fair Use Week festivities and read a roundup of the events after the fact. You may also find information on other local and national events listed on the <a href="http://fairuseweek.org/">ARL's Fair Use Week website</a>.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/FairUseWeek">@FairUseWeek</a> for a chance to win a Fair Use Week T-shirt or tote bag! And thank you for joining us in celebrating the power of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">the four factors</a> to transform teaching, learning, and&nbsp;scholarship.</p>

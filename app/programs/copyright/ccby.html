<blockquote><em>The Harvard Library advances scholarship and teaching by committing itself to the creation, application, preservation and dissemination of knowledge.</em></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harvard Library Mission Statement available at <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/objectives-priorities">http://library.harvard.edu/objectives-priorities</a></p>

<p>The Harvard Library acts as steward of the University’s collections; we preserve and make them accessible for research, scholarship, and education. Our web pages provide public access to a wide range of materials in many media, including online exhibits, digitized text collections, digital image repositories, archival finding aids, and our catalog.</p>

<p>Enabling open access to these collections and resources goes hand in hand with Harvard Library’s commitment to the widespread dissemination of knowledge.</p>

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>An essential part of our mission is to make information and resources available for educational and scholarly purposes consistent with copyright law. We evaluate copyright before making collections material available online. When possible, we provide rights information in catalog records, finding aids, and other information that accompanies collections or items. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of that information.  It is the user’s obligation to evaluate rights issues in light of their own use. The Library makes no express or implied warranty to others who wish to use the content on its web pages. Transmission or reproduction of protected items beyond that allowed by copyright exceptions such as fair use or by specific agreement requires the permission of the copyright owner. </p>

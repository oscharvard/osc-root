In 2008, Harvard's Faculty of Arts & Sciences [voted unanimously]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/fas/) to give the Harvard a nonexclusive, irrevocable right to distribute their scholarly articles for any non-commercial purpose. In the years since, the remaining eight Harvard schools voted to establish similar open-access (OA) policies, and several research centers have joined their number.

In the words of OSC Director Peter Suber, author of [Open Access](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_%28the_book%29), "The basic idea of OA is simple: Make research literature available online without price barriers and without most permission barriers."

Scholarly articles provided to the university are stored, preserved, and made freely accessible in digital form in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard University Library's open access repository.  The repository has the institution of Harvard standing behind it to ensure its availability, longevity, and functionality.

## Harvard Authors

## Beyond Harvard

If you are considering adopting an open access policy at your institution, we encourage you to download and review our [model policy language]({{site.baseurl}}/modelpolicy/) and [good-practices guide](https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies), which represent the accumulated experience of multiple institutions that have drafted and implemented open access policies. See also our [advocacy section]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/advocacy/).

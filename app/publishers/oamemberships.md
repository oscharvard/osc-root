To contact Harvard Library about an open-access membership or another kind of support for open access, please email [HL-OA-Support@calists.harvard.edu](mailto:HL-OA-Support@calists.harvard.edu).

In your email please include a full description of your request or proposal, or link to a web page with such a description. This should include a statement of the benefits to Harvard, the price or requested contribution, and (if applicable) the beginning and end dates. Unfortunately we cannot consider a request for a discussion or demonstration until weâ€™ve had a chance to review a full description. If you have any questions, please send them to the same address.

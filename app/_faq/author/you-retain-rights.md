No. Authors still retain ownership and control of the copyright in their writings, subject only to Harvard's prior, nonexclusive license. 

For non-faculty authors, the individual open-access license only covers authors who choose to sign it. Even then it is like the faculty licenses, and leaves ownership and control in the hands of the authors, subject only to the nonexclusive rights previously granted to Harvard.

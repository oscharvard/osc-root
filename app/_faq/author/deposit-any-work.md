Much of your work — for example, anything authored before the date an open-access policy was [passed in your school](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or before you signed the [individual open-access license](#individual-license) — is not covered by the license to Harvard. In those cases, your right to reuse your own work is limited to the terms of the agreements you signed with your publishers. In most cases, those publishing agreements give you more extensive reuse rights for the [accepted author manuscript](#what-version) than for the published version or version of record.

Hence, even when you are not allowed to distribute the published version, you may be able to make your accepted author manuscript available for download in DASH without violating the agreement with your publisher. Let us [investigate this for you](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) and we'll make a recommendation.

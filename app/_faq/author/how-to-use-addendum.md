Complete an appropriate form of addendum, sign and date the form, add a statement to the publisher's agreement making it subject to the addendum, and attach the addendum to the publisher's agreement. We recommend the [addendum generator](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/addendum/) to authors subject to [school-level policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or the individual open-access license.

If you have questions about how to use the addendum generator, [contact the Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu).

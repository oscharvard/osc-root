No. The [school-level open-access policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) do not apply to any articles that were completed before the policy at your school was adopted, nor to any articles for which you entered into an incompatible publishing agreement before the policy was adopted. 

If you are non-faculty author, you are not subject to the school-level policies. However, if you sign the voluntary [individual open-access license](#individual-license), then it too will not apply to articles written before you signed the license.

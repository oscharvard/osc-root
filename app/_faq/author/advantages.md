The Harvard open-access license:

- Gives authors permission to make their work open access without the difficulty or uncertainty of negotiating with publishers;
- Enables the university to help authors make their works open access; 
- Preserves author freedom to publish in the journals of their choice;
- Preserves author freedom to decide for or against open access for each publication; and 
- Enhances author rights to reuse their work, and gives authors more rights over their own work than standard, or even progressive, publishing contracts.

The chief benefit of the open-access license is the way it fosters open access itself. While the benefits of open access itself are too numerous to list here, we will mention one. Research has [repeatedly](http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html) [shown](https://web.archive.org/web/20160707131501/http://sparceurope.org/oaca_table/) that articles that are free online are cited more often than articles that are not free online, and this trend is increasing over time. This phenomenon is often called the open-access citation or impact advantage.

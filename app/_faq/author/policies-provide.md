The [policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) have two basic provisions. First, faculty commit to deposit a [certain version](#what-version) of their future scholarly articles in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository. Second, faculty grant certain nonexclusive rights over their future scholarly articles to Harvard, authorizing it to make those deposited articles open access. This grant of nonexclusive rights is not equivalent to a grant of ownership. It includes waiver and embargo options to enhance author freedom and control over their work. 

Sometimes we call this grant of nonexclusive rights the Harvard open-access license. 

The policies do _not_ require authors to submit new scholarly articles to any particular type of journals, such as open-access journals. On the contrary, the policies deliberately allow authors to submit new work to the journals of their choice.

All Harvard schools now have open-access policies, each one adopted by faculty vote. In their major provisions, they are identical.

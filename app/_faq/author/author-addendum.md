An author addendum is a proposed modification of a publishing contract. If accepted by the publisher, it modifies the contract, for example, in order to take proper account of the Harvard open-access  license or to allow author to retain rights that would otherwise have been transferred to the publisher. 

Here is a [sample addendum](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/sample_addendum/) developed specifically to deal with the prior license granted to Harvard.

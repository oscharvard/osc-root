Harvard faculty are already covered by open-access licenses through the [school-level open-access policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/). Current administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, fellows, students, and other non-faculty researchers at Harvard may create a similar license for themselves through the voluntary [individual open-access license](#individual-license).

But with or without an open-access license, scholarly works by Harvard affiliates are welcome in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/).

The [policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) ask authors to deposit "the final version of the article". But since our policies were adopted, the more self-explanatory term "accepted author manuscript" has become more widely accepted for describing the version we have in mind.

The accepted author manuscript of a work is the version approved by peer review, or the last version the author sends to the publisher after peer review. It does not include unilateral edits made by the journal after peer review, or the journal's look and feel.

In a few cases we will deposit the published version, also called the version of record. For example, we will deposit this version when [Harvard's HOPE fund](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/programs/hope/) pays an article processing charge for that article, or when the publisher gives permission to deposit that version. If you're not certain whether we could deposit the version of record in a given case, please [contact](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) the Office for Scholarly Communication.

Only scholarly articles. 

We focus on scholarly articles because, in the language of the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml), these are the primary works that scholars publish "for the sake of inquiry and knowledge" and "give to the world without expectation of payment." Scholarly articles are typically presented in peer-reviewed scholarly journals and conference proceedings.

While DASH, the Harvard repository, welcomes scholarly works other than articles, the policies only cover articles. Among the works outside the category of scholarly articles are books, popular articles, commissioned articles, fiction and poetry, encyclopedia entries, ephemeral writings, lecture notes, and lecture videos. 

If you wonder whether a given work is covered the policies or welcome in DASH, please contact the [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu). 

Like the [school-level policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) for faculty, the voluntary [individual open-access license](#individual-license) is also limited to scholarly articles.

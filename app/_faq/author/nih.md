Your article will be subject to the [NIH Public Access Policy](https://publicaccess.nih.gov/) if it is peer reviewed and arose, in whole or in part, from NIH-funded research and is accepted for publication on or after April 7, 2008.

The _NIH policy_ cannot be waived. (The same is true of open-access policies from many other funding agencies. [Look up your funder in the ROARMAP database](https://roarmap.eprints.org/) for more information.) You may, however, [obtain a waiver](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363046/submit) of the license _to Harvard_ for an article.

The license granted to Harvard through the [school-level policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) and the [individual open-access license](#individual-license) includes rights sufficient to comply with the NIH policy, but also provides other nonexclusive rights that will enable Harvard and faculty authors to use their articles in additional waysâ€”for example, depositing them in a Harvard repository.

For more on compliance with the NIH policy, please see the [details and instructions](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/HarvardNIHPolicy) from Harvard Medical School.

Your article will also be subject to the NIH Public Access Policy if it is peer reviewed and arose, in whole or in part, from NIH-funded research and is accepted for publication on or after April 7, 2008.

Unlike the Open Access Policy, the NIH policy is mandatory and cannot be waived. As part of the University's compliance strategy for the NIH policy, NIH-funded investigators will grant Harvard a limited, nonexclusive license to use the investigators' articles to comply with the NIH policy, and to authorize NIH to use the articles and make them publicly available in accordance with the NIH policy. This is separate from the license granted under the Open Access Policy. The license granted to Harvard under the Open Access Policy includes rights sufficient to comply with the NIH policy, but also provides other nonexclusive rights that will enable Harvard and faculty authors to use their articles in additional waysâ€”for example, including them in a Harvard repository.

If an NIH-funded article is covered by the Open Access Policy, you therefore should use the addendum generator. However, if you or another faculty author have requested or plan to request a waiver of the Open Access Policy for the article, you should use the NIH addendum Harvard has developed, or another form of addendum that reserves, at minimum, the rights under copyright necessary to comply with the NIH Public Access Policy. Though you may elect to obtain a waiver of the Open Access Policy for an article, you must reserve rights sufficient to comply with the NIH policy when you enter into a publication agreement for the article. For more information on the NIH addendum and compliance with that policy, please see the Harvard web site dedicated to the NIH Public Access Policy.

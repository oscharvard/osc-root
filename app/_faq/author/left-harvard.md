No. Once you are no longer affiliated with Harvard, any articles you write will not be subject to the [open-access policies at your school](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) and will not be licensed to Harvard. Likewise, the voluntary [individual open-access license](#individual-license) applies only as long as the author is affiliated with Harvard.

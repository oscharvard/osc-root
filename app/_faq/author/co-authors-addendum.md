Even if you are not the corresponding author, you may still decide to use the addendum with the publisher's agreement so that the terms of the agreement will not be in conflict with the license granted to Harvard. You can use the [addendum generator](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/addendum/) to create an addendum for the article that may be used by your corresponding co-author.

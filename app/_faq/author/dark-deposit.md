A dark deposit is a work in [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/) whose full text is not open access, even when information about the work (citation, abstract, etc.) is open access.

We try to minimize dark deposits, and make all DASH deposits open access. But we make deposits dark in two circumstances:

1. When the author has requested an embargo, and
2. When we don't have rights to provide open access to the version(s) available to us.

In the first case, we make the work dark during the embargo period, and open access when the embargo expires.

In the second case, we might lack the relevant rights for a number of reasons:

- The author has [obtained a waiver](#how-to-waive) of the license granted to Harvard; 
- The work was published before the author granted nonexclusive rights to Harvard, either through the [open-access policy at his/her school](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or with the [individual open-access license](#individual-license); or
- Our rights only apply to a certain version of the work and we don't yet have a copy of that version.

Regardless of the cause, we will make a version of the work open access if or when we obtain the rights to do so.

In general, when a work is subject to a Harvard open-access policy, we have nonexclusive rights to provide open access to the [accepted author manuscript](#what-version) (AAM), and not the version of record (VOR). If the author submits the VOR to DASH, either we hold it or make it dark until we can obtain the AAM or until we obtain permission to distribute the VOR.

You have a number of options, whether you are covered by the [school-level open-access policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or the [individual open-access license](#individual-license). You may:

- [Obtain a waiver](#how-to-waive) of the license and let the publisher know that you have done so; or 
- Obtain an embargo to delay deposit of the work in DASH and let the publisher know you have done so; or  
- Work to persuade the publisher that it should accept Harvard's nonexclusive license in order to be able to publish your article; or finally, 
- Try to seek a different publisher. The [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) would be happy to help in the process of working with publishers or picking an option that works best for you. 

We have not heard of a single case in which a journal has refused to publish an article merely because of the prior license to Harvard. This is because the waiver and embargo options offer complete protection to publishers who wish to take advantage of them.

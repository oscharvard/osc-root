It may still be a good idea to use the addendum. The nonexclusive license to Harvard enables the university to allow you and others to make various beneficial uses of the article, which may be in conflict with provisions of the publication agreement. To avoid a conflicting transfer of copyright to the publisher and to protect yourself from breach of contract, you may still want to attach an addendum. 

If the publisher's agreement, however, is wholly consistent with Harvard's license, you would not need to use the addendum.

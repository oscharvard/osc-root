Yes. Harvard may permit you and others to make derivative works based on the articles that fall under the open-access license, whether you are covered by a [school-level policy](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or the voluntary [individual open-access license](#individual-license). However, Harvard would only exercise this right with permission from the author and in order to advance the aims of the policy.

Harvard recognizes authors' interest in the integrity of their scholarly articles. If Harvard allows the display or distribution of any derivative work that modifies the substance of the original document (e.g., an abridgment), it will require that the derivative work include a citation, hyperlink or similar reference to the original document and that it appropriately identify the nature of the revision (e.g., "abridged from...").

As technology and modes of distributing and using scholarly content evolve, it may serve the interests of research and education for Harvard to adjust the derivative-work rights granted to the public. In any such decisions, the Office for Scholarly Communication will be guided by its [Faculty Advisory Committee](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/about/committee/).

Yes. If your article cannot be made publicly available because you [obtained a waiver](#how-to-waive) of the Harvard license, we encourage you to deposit a copy in [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository. We will make it "dark". We will not make the text open access, but will store it for preservation purposes. We will provide open access to the metadata or bibliographic information, to facilitate indexing by search engines and public awareness of your article.

Even if you obtain a waiver, the publisher's agreement may provide sufficient rights to allow copies of your article to be made publicly available through the Harvard repository. You may also be able to negotiate these rights. 

The publisher may ask that certain conditions be met, some of which the repository can accommodate (for example, an embargo period during which the article will not be made publicly available). Information about publishers' standard policies on open access is available from the [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) project (though Harvard has not verified the accuracy of that information).

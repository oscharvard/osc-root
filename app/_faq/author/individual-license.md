This a voluntary open-access license that any Harvard researchers may choose for their own scholarly articles. Because Harvard faculty are already covered by open-access licenses through the [school-level open-access policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/), in practice the individual open-access license is for non-faculty researchers, such as administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, fellows, and students. 

Through the school-level open-access policies, faculty grant Harvard certain nonexclusive rights to their future scholarly articles. These enable Harvard to make a [certain version](#what-version) of those articles open access through [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository. Moreover, they enable Harvard to grant the same rights back to the authors. The individual open-access license grants Harvard exactly the same set of nonexclusive rights, for exactly the [same purposes](#what-will-harvard-do). In that sense, it gives non-faculty researchers the [same benefits](#advantages) that the school-level policies give faculty. 

Just as faculty may obtain [waivers](#how-to-waive) from their open-access license, those who sign the individual open-access license may also obtain waivers.

To sign the Individual Open-Access License, just sign our [assistance authorization form](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/authorization/).

The license works best when authors sign it before they sign publishing contracts. For that reason, and because it permits waivers for any given work, we encourage interested authors to sign the open-access license soon, or before they publish their next scholarly article.

Authors only need to sign the license once for the rest of their career at Harvard, not once per paper. It lasts as long as the author is affiliated with Harvard.

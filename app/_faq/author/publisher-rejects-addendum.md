You have a number of options. Whether you are covered by the [school-level policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) or the [individual open-access license](#individual-license), you may obtain a [waiver](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363046/submit) of the license granted to Harvard.

Alternatively, you can work to persuade the publisher that it should accept Harvard's non-exclusive license in order to be able to publish your article, or you may seek a different publisher. You can consult with the [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) for help in the process of working with publishers and addressing their specific concerns.

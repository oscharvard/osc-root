Here are some examples:

- __Availability in DASH__. Harvard has set up an open-access repository called [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/) to distribute the scholarly articles deposited by Harvard researchers.

- __Reuse by the author__. When Harvard receives the grant of nonexclusive rights from faculty, it grants the same rights back to the faculty. The result is that faculty receive more rights from the OA policy, to use and reuse their own work, than they received under their publishing contracts.

- __Creation of derivative works__. Harvard may use derivative work rights to include articles in a collection or database, to change document formats, to prepare abridgments, or to create other derivative works that we cannot currently foresee. Harvard will not authorize derivative works without the author's permission. 

- __Non-commercial distribution__. Through the transferability provision, Harvard may further allow others to distribute content in [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/), provided that the articles are not sold for profit. For instance, faculty at other institutions could be given permission to make copies for free distribution directly to their students.

- __Instructional purposes__. The Harvard open-access license grants Harvard the right to license articles for free use in a course pack, so long as the course pack is not sold for profit. Alternatively, those seeking to include articles in a coursepack could continue to get permissions from the publisher, typically by paying royalties to the publisher. To take another example, Harvard could also authorize others to make articles available online (for example, on a course website or another repository), provided that these were not sold for a profit.

- __Harvesting, indexing, and other services__. Consistent with the goals of open access and ensuring wide visibility and availability of scholarly articles, the license allows Harvard to enable both commercial and nonprofit entities to use the articles to provide search or other services, so long as the articles are not being sold for a profit. For instance, the license allows Harvard to enable the articles to be harvested and indexed by search services, such as Google Scholar, and to be used to provide other value-added services that don't involve selling the articles themselves for a profit. Harvard also could authorize use of the articles in a commercial service that provides information extracted from the articles (but not the full text itself), such as bibliographic data or citation lists.

- __Technological innovation__. If new means of distributing or making the articles available evolve during the lengthy term of copyright, the license is intended to give Harvard the flexibility to use those means to advance the purposes of the open-access policy, provided always that the articles are not sold for a profit.

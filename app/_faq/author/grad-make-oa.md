You will be submitting your thesis or dissertation through [ETDs @ Harvard](https://etds.lib.harvard.edu/), Harvard's centrally supported and locally customized electronic submission system. 

Submission consists of a simple five-step process that takes about 10 minutes to complete. During this time you will provide contact information for, document metadata about, and upload a PDF of your work. 

You will have the opportunity to submit an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) in the submission process. Additionally, you will be agreeing to Harvardâ€™s author agreement, which grants the University a non-exclusive license to preserve, reproduce, and display your work.  

Once approved by your School, your thesis or dissertation will be sent to various downstream Library systems, including [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/) (for access); [DRS](https://library.harvard.edu/lts/systems/drs) (for preservation); and [HOLLIS](https://hollis.harvard.edu) (for discovery). 

If you have questions related to this process or about any associated policies, then please contact your degree-granting department. If you have questions about DASH, then please [contact the Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu).

Yes. If you are a co-author of an article, you should inform your fellow co-authors about the nonexclusive license that you have granted Harvard under the [school-level open-access policies](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/) (or the [individual open-access license](#individual-license). If they object to the license, and cannot be convinced it is beneficial, then remember that you can [obtain a waiver](#how-to-waive) for the article.

Each joint author of an article holds copyright in the article and, individually, has the authority to grant Harvard a nonexclusive license. However, one waiver from one author is sufficient to waive the license to Harvard. 

Please [contact us](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) with any questions you may have about seeking a waiver for a co-authored paper.

Compliance for this purpose means that you have signed an [assistance authorization form](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/proxy/webform) and submitted [appropriate versions](/authors/faq/#what-version) of a substantial number of [your policy-covered articles](/policies/) to [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu) (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard), Harvard's open-access repository.

There are many ways to submit these articles, but the easiest is to use our [quick-submit](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363045/submit) form. The [Office for Scholarly Communication](/) (OSC) is available to help with compliance.

If you've signed the assistance authorization form and submitted the relevant files to the OSC, then you've satisfied this condition, even if the OSC needs more time before it can finish depositing the files in DASH.

In the case of an article with a [waiver](/authors/waiver/) of the Harvard license, you should still submit a copy of the article to the OSC, for deposit in DASH, in accord with the Harvard open-access policies. OSC will not make that copy publicly available unless it has permission to do so.

In the case of co-authored articles, this condition applies to all Harvard-affiliated co-authors.

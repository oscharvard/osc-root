We’ll need you to provide us with a list of your past publications. We’ll review them to determine when we already have permission to make them open access through DASH (for example, from the Harvard OA policies or from your publishers) and when we’d have to seek permission.

When we already have permission, then we’ll deposit the works in <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/">DASH</a> on your behalf. Sometimes we’ll need you to provide us with <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/pages/FAQ#which-version-of-my-article-or-other-material-should-i-deposit">appropriate versions</a> of the texts. In those cases, we’ll contact you with specific requests.

When we don’t already have permission to distribute a work, we’ll usually try to seek permission from the publisher.

CV Scrapes are always voluntary. The process typically takes 8-10 weeks.

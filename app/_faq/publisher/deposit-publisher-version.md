The open-access policies do not require deposit of the publisher's final version, that is, the version of the article distributed by the publisher to readers of the journal, incorporating any copy editing, layout, and typesetting done by the publisher. Moreover, in typical cases, the author will not have the rights necessary to submit that version to the repository for distribution. However, where the author has obtained from the publisher or otherwise has the necessary rights, and wishes to deposit that version, the author may do so.

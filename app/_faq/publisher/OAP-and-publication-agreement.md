No. When an article is subject to the Harvard license, the author may still transfer _non-exclusive_ publication and other rights to a publisher. The Office for Scholarly Communication invites publishers to accommodate university open-access policies in their author agreements just as they have done for open-access policies at funding agencies. 

Alternatively, Harvard authors may [use an addendum](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/addendum/) to make publication agreements consistent with Harvard policies.    

Finally, authors may [obtain waivers](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/faq/#how-to-waive) from the Harvard license.

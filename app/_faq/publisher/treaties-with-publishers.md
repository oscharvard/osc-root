Several publishers have either confirmed that their policies are consistent with the open-access policy or have negotiated an agreement to clarify and simplify procedures for publishing articles that fall under the policy. (The first such was an agreement with the American Physical Society.) The Office for Scholarly Communication has made available [a list of publishers]({{site.baseurl}}/publishers/treaties/) who are "easiest to publish with."

A model agreement can be found [here](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/model-pub-agreement-090430.pdf).

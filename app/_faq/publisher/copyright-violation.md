If the paper is in DASH, and if you'd like to discuss the situation, please contact the [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu). We'd be happy to talk.

To send a takedown notice, please [contact Harvard's DMCA agent](mailto:dmca@harvard.edu). This is the course to take whether the paper is in DASH or on a different Harvard site, such as the web site of a faculty member, student, department, or lab. Harvard will handle the notice in a manner consistent with the DMCA.

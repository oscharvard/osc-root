The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, the Ash Center adopts the following policy: Each faculty, fellow, and staff member grants to Harvard University permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles. More specifically, each faculty, fellow, and staff member grants to Harvard a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of the Ash Center except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the faculty, fellow, and staff member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost’s designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon express direction by a faculty, fellow, and staff member.

Each faculty, fellow, and staff member will provide an electronic copy of the author’s final version of each article no later than the date of its publication at no charge to the appropriate representative of the Provost’s Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF) specified by the Provost’s Office.

The Provost’s Office may make the article available to the public in an open-access repository, including the open Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH) repository. Furthermore, the Ash Center may also make such articles available to the public without charge. The Office of the Provost in consultation with the Director of the Ash Center will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the faculty, fellow, and staff member from time to time.

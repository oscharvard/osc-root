The OSC supports all Harvard faculty and affiliates as you publish  and make decisions regarding your scholarly works. Our [Author FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/authors/faq/) will help you understand how the Open Access Policy affects you, and our [Copyright Advisor and First Responders]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/) are available to answer your questions about copyright and fair use.

## DASH

Open your scholarship to the world by [depositing your work](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363045/submit) in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu), or [ask the OSC](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Request%20for%20assistance%20with%20DASH) and we can do it for you. We provide a wide variety of services&mdash;we'll study your CV and do the legal legwork, and our Open Access Fellows will deposit your articles on your behalf.

You'll love the [statistics](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/mydash/) you receive each month about who is reading your scholarship&mdash;and so will your tenure committee. You'll enjoy [increased citation rates](http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=560&Itemid=391), Google optimization, and a number of other benefits.

## Prior to Publication

- Through the [HOPE program]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/), Harvard researchers can apply for funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees in eligible open-access journals for which no alternative funding is available.

- Publishers' agreements concerning publication of articles often contain provisions that are inconsistent with the prior license granted to Harvard under the Open Access Policy. An [author addendum](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/addendum/), however, is a simple legal tool that can resolve the conflict.

- Harvard authors subject to the Open Access Policy may request a [waiver](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363046/submit) of Harvard's nonexclusive license on an article-by-article basis.

- Several publishers have formally agreed to recognize Harvard's rights under the Open Access Policy. We are grateful to [these publishers]({{site.baseurl}}/publishers/treaties/) for their full support of access to Harvard faculty's writings.

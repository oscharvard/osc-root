You may request a waiver of the [open-access license granted to Harvard]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/) on an article-by-article basis. Simply use the [Waiver Generator](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37363046/submit).

Even if you obtain a waiver for a given article, you should still deposit the [accepted author manuscript](#what-version) in [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/DASH). It can be made available after a delay, or [kept "dark"](#dark-deposit) depending on the nature of your publication agreement. The OSC can help determine what kind of distribution is appropriate for the work.

If your article is [subject to the NIH Public Access policy](#nih), note that your obligations under the NIH Public Access Policy cannot be waived. The same may be true of open-access policies at some other funding agencies. [Look up your funder in the ROARMAP database](https://roarmap.eprints.org/) for more information.
